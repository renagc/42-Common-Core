| 0  |**[libft](https://github.com/renagc/42-Common-Core/tree/main/rank_0/42_libft)**|                 This project is the very first project as a student at 42. To succeed, it is necessary to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that will be used throughout the entire curriculum.                 | ```âœ… done```  | |
| 1  |            **[ft_printf](https://github.com/renagc/42_ft_printf)**            |                          This project is pretty straightforward. It requires recoding printf, which involves learning what variadic functions are and how to implement them. Once validated, this function will be reused in future projects.                          | ```âœ… done```  | |
